This is just a simple hobyst project for voice recognition and control using the beaaglebone black microcontroller.
The aim is to be able to control the openning and closing of a garage gate just by using voice commands. I would also like to control household appliances including LED lights and dimming them when needed.
This project is on-going and I want to build it from the ground up and implement it on different microcontrollers such as dsPICs, STM32, and more.
For a start, I plan to use already made voice recognition APIs and models such as those provided by google and amazon, but later on in the project, I plan to design my own voice recognition models and train them myself.
I will be updating my progress reports in this repository for every progress I make.
